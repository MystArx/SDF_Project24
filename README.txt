This is Readme file for SDF Project Even24 (A3 batch) 

Welcome to our game development project where we blend the nostalgia of classic arcade games with the power of modern C++ programming. 
In this venture, we'll be creating not just one, but two iconic games: Ping Pong and Snake. 

About the Games:

Ping Pong
Ping Pong is one of the earliest arcade games. 
Players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, aiming to score points against their opponent.

Snake
Snake game challenges players to control a growing snake as it navigates around obstacles and consumes food items.
The game becomes increasingly challenging as the snake grows longer, testing players' reflexes and strategic thinking.

Project Goals:

Mastery of C++ Game Development 
Throughout this project, we'll delve into C++ game development, mastering concepts such as object-oriented programming, collision detection and graphics rendering using libraries like SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).

Gameplay Fusion and Innovation: By combining elements from Ping Pong and Snake, we explore how to merge gameplay mechanics.
Player Experience Enhancement: Our objective is to create games that are not only enjoyable to play but also provide a seamless and immersive experience for the player.

Tools and Technologies:

C++ Programming Language: Leveraging the power of C++, we have write efficient code to implement game logic, mechanics, and user interactions.
Windows.h header files
Development Environment: W work within our preferred C++ development environment, whether it's Visual Studio, Code::Blocks.
